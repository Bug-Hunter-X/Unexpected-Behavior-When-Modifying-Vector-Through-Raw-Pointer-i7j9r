This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to using raw pointers with vectors. The `bug.rs` file shows code that attempts to modify a vector through a raw pointer, but this approach is unsafe and can lead to unexpected behavior because the vector's internal data could be moved when its capacity is exceeded. The `bugSolution.rs` offers a safer approach to achieve the same outcome without the risk of undefined behavior. This example highlights the importance of safe memory management in Rust.
